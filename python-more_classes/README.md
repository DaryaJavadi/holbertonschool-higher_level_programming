# Python - More Classes and Objects

### Tasks
#### 0. Simple rectangle
- Implement an empty class named Rectangle that defines a rectangle.

#### 1. Real Definition of a Rectangle
- Define the Rectangle with private attributes width and height and include property setters and getters to validate type and enforce non-negative values.

#### 2. Area and Perimeter
- Extend the Rectangle class to calculate and return the area and perimeter. Implement zero-checks for width or height.

#### 3. String Representation
- Implement the __str__ method in the Rectangle class to provide a string representation using the # character.

#### 4. Eval is Magic
- Enhance the Rectangle class by adding the __repr__ method to allow instance recreation using eval().

#### 5. Detect instance deletion
- Implement a destructor in the Rectangle class to print a message when an instance is deleted.

#### 6. How Many Instances
- Track the number of Rectangle instances with a class attribute that increments/decrements with each instance creation/deletion.

#### 7. Change Representation
- Modify the Rectangle class to allow changing the symbol used in the string representation dynamically.

#### 8. Compare rectangles
- Add a static method to the Rectangle class to compare the area of two rectangles and return the bigger or the first if they are equal.

  

#### 9. A Square is a Rectangle
- Implement a class method in the Rectangle class that allows creating a square (a rectangle with equal width and height).
