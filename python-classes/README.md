# Python - Classes and Objects

## Background Context

Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is essential for effective Python programming. This project is designed to give you practical experience with OOP concepts. Experimentation and practice are key, so type, test, and understand each example thoroughly.

## Project Tasks

### 0. My First Square

An empty class `Square` that defines a square.

### 1. Square with size

Class `Square` defines a square by size, without type/value verification.

### 2. Size validation

Adds type and value validation to the size attribute of the `Square` class.

### 3. Area of a Square

Introduces an instance method to compute the area of the square.

### 4. Access and update private attribute

Implementing property and property setter for private instance attribute size.

### 5. Printing a square

A method `my_print` that prints the square using the `#` character.

### 6. Coordinates of a square

Extends the `Square` class to include a `position` attribute with getter and setter.
