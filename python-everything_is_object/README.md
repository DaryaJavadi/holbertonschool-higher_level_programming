# Python - Everything is object

## Background Context

This project explores Python's object model and how it handles different types of objects. It aims to deepen understanding of Python's behavior with various object types, particularly focusing on mutability, identity, and reference concepts.

## Tasks

The project consists of multiple tasks, each focusing on different aspects of Python objects. These include:

0. Identifying object types
1. Getting variable identifiers
2-5. Comparing object references
6-9. String comparisons and identity
10-13. List comparisons and identity
14-15. List operations
16-18. Function parameter behavior
19. Copying lists
20-26. Tuple behavior
27-28. Object identity after operations
